SInce Python strat every count from 0, I will name the folders and lessons from 0. The commit messages will be using the equivalent week as is in the schedule: So, week_0 folder means Week_1 of education and Week_5 means Week_6 of education.

This is an example of my first Commit in VSCode, remember that this commit will be stored locally.
